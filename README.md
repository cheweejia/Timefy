# Timefy
Timefy aims to help you manage your limited time better, so that you can lead a happier and healthier life.

We hope to achieve our aim by developing an app that ensures you wake up on time, improves your sleep quality, and helps you boost your productivity.

## Getting Started

#### Using A Computer

Download the repository.

Open the folder in your code editor.

Using your command line, navigate to the same folder.

Install the following:

yarn (preferred)
```yarn install```

npm
```npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/bottom-tabs react-native-elements @react-native-community/datetimepicker react-native-modal-datetime-picker react-native-countdown-circle-timer moment```

#### Using An Android Device

Download the app "Expo Go".

#### Final Steps

Run ```expo start``` on your command line on your computer. It should open up a page in your browser and there should be a QR code on the bottom left of the page.

Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your Android device.

Timefy should be available for use.
